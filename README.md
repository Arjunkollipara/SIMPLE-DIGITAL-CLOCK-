THIS IS A SIMPLE DIGITAL CLOCK USING THE SWINGS IN JAVA HERE WE ARE USING A GRID LAYOUT WITH THREE ROWS AND ONE COLUMN WHERE
THE FIRST ROW USED A JLABEL THAT DISPLAYS A TEXT SAYING "MY CLOCK"
THE SECOND ROW USES A JCOMBOBOX IN WHICH IT HAS A LIST OF COUNTRY_IDS WHICH IS USED TO SELECT A TIMEZONE AND ACCORDING TO THAT 
THE ACTION LISTENER WILL BE USED TO LISTEN AND THEN BASED ON THE COUNTRY ID SELECTED BY THE USER THE THIRD ROW WHICH DISPLAYS
TIME WILL NOW SHOW THE TIME OF THE LOCATION SELECTED IN THE LIST OF COUNTRIES
